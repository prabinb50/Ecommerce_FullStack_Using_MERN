In a early days, js was used in frontend only as scription language for the browser. 
In this period the js not supported in the server so python, java, php etc were used as backend.

Later on, the concept of node.js was introduced as a runtime for js on the server side.
Now the runtime (node js) is responsible for executing the js code on the server side.

Node js is the runtime prototype/protocol which is complex and has a lot of features.
Then Express js was introduced as the framework instead of core node js.

It is also backed / server
It serves as a bridge betn frontend and database

MongoDB
It is NOSQL database.
It stores data in the form of documents and json/collections.
Backend cannot talk to database directly, it should use mongoose to talk to database.

// Steps to create backend server using express js
1. create a backend folder and go inside it
2. npm init -y
3. npm i express
4. npm i mongoose
5. "type": "module", add this in package.json
6. npm i nodemon
